A tribute to Neptune QTG.

Local store owner Craig has obtained the power of invulernability... and he isn't happy. He's had enough of the players toying around, and he wants to make you feel powerless. No weapon or any other NPC seem to come close to his power. Nothing stands a chance against him... are you willing to fight this battle?
